  title: 'HealNet - Self-supervised Acute Wound Heal-Stage Classification, MICCAI',
  description:
    'Identifying, tracking, and predicting wound heal-stage progression is a fundamental task towards proper diagnosis, effective treatment, facilitating healing, and reducing pain. Traditionally, a medical expert might observe a wound to determine the current healing state and recommend treatment. However, sourcing experts who can produce such a diagnosis solely from visual indicators can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. In addition, lesions may take several weeks to undergo the healing process, demanding resources to monitor and diagnose continually. Automating this task can be challenging; datasets that follow wound progression from onset to maturation are small, rare, and often collected without computer vision in mind. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning scheme composed of (a) learning embeddings of wound’s temporal dynamics, (b) clustering for automatic stage discovery, and (c) fine-tuned classification. The proposed self-supervised and flexible learning framework is biologically inspired and trained on a small dataset with zero human labeling. The HealNet framework achieved high pre-text and downstream classification accuracy; when evaluated on held-out test data, HealNet achieved 97.7% pre-text accuracy and 90.62% heal-stage classification accuracy.',
