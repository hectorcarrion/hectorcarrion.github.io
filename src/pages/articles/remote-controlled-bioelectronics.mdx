  title: 'Remote-Controlled Wireless Bioelectronics for Fluoxetine Therapy to Promote Wound Healing in a Porcine Model',
  description: 'Wound healing is a significant opportunity in biomedical science, requiring precise therapeutic delivery and real-time monitoring. Bioelectronic devices address this need and require further validation in large animal models that reflect human healing dynamics. This work introduces a wireless, remotely controlled bioelectronic platform with an iontophoretic pump to deliver fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that modulates inflammation and promotes wound repair. Treatment over 3 days in a porcine model increased re-epithelialization by 37% and reduced inflammation, as shown by a 33% decrease in the ratio of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-reparative M2 macrophages compared to controls. The platform accelerated early wound healing and stimulated neuronal growth at the wound site.',
